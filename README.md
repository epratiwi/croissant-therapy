# Croissant Therapy
## Code Academy Portfolio Project
---
### About The Project
This is my first python project and I have decided to create a croissant picker to help me decide which croissant I should buy depending on which bakery I want to go to that day, what type of croissant I want and what my budget is.

---
### Project Features
This program allows users to:
1. Input their name
2. Choose which bakery they want to go to. (Beacoup, Nemesis or Angus T)
3. Choose the type of croissant they want. (Safe, Sweet, Savoury or Adventurous)
4. Input their budget for croissant

Based on those information, the program will then generate a randomized croissant for the user!
